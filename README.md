## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![image1](https://github.com/Ajsforlife/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/challenge_pics/deliverable1.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variables/coefficients that provide non-random amounts of variance to the MPG values on the dataset are vehicle_length ,vehicle_weight and ground_clearance. These all have extremely small Pr(>|t|) values.
    
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, because the p-value is significantly lower then .05.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
This linear model does not predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because only vehicle weight provides data that is likely to provide random amounts of variance to predict the mpg. while a major of the other variables provide non-random variance like stated above.
